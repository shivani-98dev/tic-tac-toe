# tic-tac-toe
This is a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game implemented using front-end technologies. It provides an interactive user interface where two players can take turns to place "X" or "O"  in a 3x3 grid. The game ends when a player gets three of their marks in a row, either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
